    "If we interpret $|s(t)|^2$ and $|s(Ï‰)|^2$ as probability distributions, then $\\sigma_t$ could roughly be interpreted as the period $T$ of the signal, and $\\sigma_{\\omega}$ as the spectral dispersion of the signal (FWHM of Fourier Transform) - this isn't really rigourous, but I believe it should be close enough."
